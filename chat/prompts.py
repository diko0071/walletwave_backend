Avaliable categories you MUST to use when filtering: 
{categories}

Avaliable transaction types you MUST to use when filtering: 
{transaction_types}

Avaliable currencies you MUST to use when filtering: 
{currencies}

Rules you must to keep in mind: 
- You MUST filter by user id, if you will not — the SQL query won't be executed. 
- By default you should use converted amount and currency, because user asked for this approach. 
- You should use transaction_date for filtering, if user asked for transactions in specific date. Because it is actual field filled by user.
- For fields: category, transaction_type and currency you MUST use ONLY values above, because it is the only values that are avaliable in the database.
- The answer MUST BE ONLY SQL QUERY without any additional characters, because it will be used in the application as is.


Example pairs of questions and desirable output: 

Example 1: 
User question:
How much did I spend on the food last year?

Desirable output: 
```
SELECT SUM(converted_amount) 
FROM public.transaction_transaction 
WHERE category = 'Food & Drinks' 
AND transaction_date > '2023-12-31'
```

Example 2: 
User question: 
How much my spend has increased compare this month with the same month last year?

Desirable output: 
```
SELECT
  SUM(converted_amount) AS current_month_spend,
  SUM(converted_amount) AS last_year_same_month_spend,
  SUM(converted_amount) - SUM(converted_amount) AS spend_increase
FROM
  public.transaction_transaction
WHERE
  user_id = '7f0f31dc-5851-4a71-ac98-45f620f94358'
  AND transaction_date BETWEEN '2023-12-01' AND '2023-12-31'
  AND transaction_date BETWEEN '2022-12-01' AND '2022-12-31';
```

Example 3: 
User question: 
Show me the amount transactions by category?

Desirable output: 
```
SELECT
  SUM(converted_amount) AS current_month_spend,
  SUM(converted_amount) AS last_year_same_month_spend,
  SUM(converted_amount) - SUM(converted_amount) AS spend_increase
FROM
  transaction_transaction
WHERE
  user_id = '7f0f31dc-5851-4a71-ac98-45f620f94358'
  AND transaction_date BETWEEN '2023-12-01' AND '2023-12-31'
  AND transaction_date BETWEEN '2022-12-01' AND '2022-12-31';
```

Think step by step and generate SQL wihtout any additional characters, because it will be used in the application as is.

Your main goal is to convert user questions to JSON. 

Example: 
[
{
    "amount": "50.00",
    "description": "Metro Tickets",
    "category": "Utilities & Bills",
    "transaction_currency": "USD",
    "transaction_date": "{current_date}"

# Example 1:
# Request: 
# "Metro 50 AED"
# Expected answer:
[

    "description": "Metro Tickets",
    "category": "Utilities & Bills",
    "transaction_currency": "AED",

    "description": "Flowers for mother",
    "category": "Gifts",
    "transaction_currency": "USD",
    "transaction_date": "{current_date}"
}
]
# Example 2:

If user once specified the currency it means that you MUST use it like: 
User: breafast 10 usd, dinner 5.
[

    "description": "Dinner",
    "category": "Food & Drinks",
    "transaction_currency": "USD",
    "transaction_date": "{current_date}"

Transactions can also be empty, but you still MUST add them with 0.00 value:
User: breafast 10 usd, dinner .
[
{
    "amount": "10.00",
    "description": "Breakfast",
    "category": "Food & Drinks",

    "description": "Dinner",
    "category": "Food & Drinks",
    "transaction_currency": "USD",
    "transaction_date": "{current_date}"
}
]

You have available categories: Travel, Food & Drinks, Entertainment, Utilities & Bills, Health & Wellness, Shopping, Education, Gifts, Rent, Other. 

You MUST use ONLY THIS CURRENCY CODES: 
- USD
- EUR
- RUB
- AED
- GBP
- AUD
- KZT

NEVER use others.

If user once specified the currency it means that you MUST use it.

NEVER invent new. Use the explicit names as you see above.

Current day should be in format YYYY-MM-DD. Exmaple: 2024-05-06.

If user didn't specify the date — you MUST use today date.

JSON must BE without any additional characters. Without '''JSON'' at all. NEVER add additional characters, only JSON.

If question: How much did I spend last month?

Your goal is based on trasaction information generate a report how user should improve their finance. 

It should be VERY concise and include 3 setnsnces:
- General overview about all the spendings. 
- What user did improved based on previous week report and new week transactions.
- What should not be done in the future and can be easily avoided (because it is redundant). 
- What should user do better next week to save more money. 

It MUST be statements only with examples and numbers. When you recommend something — it MUST be done with numbers and exisiting transactions that user made. 

It should be in the structure:
1. Overview: {overview}
2. Improved things: {improved_things}
3. Bad things: {bad_things}
4. What you can do better: {proposal}

It should not be the points about 1 thing. You need to look up to all transaction and find something that can be avoided or improved over time. 

Always follow the structure above. No additional characters, no additional comments. Exactly 4 topics.

If previous report is not available — put in improved things: "No previous data available".
